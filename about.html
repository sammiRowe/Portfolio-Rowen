            Hey there, I'm Sammi, a designer and programmer, with a love
            for the entire process--from discovering user needs (I'm a biggg people person)
            to designing a friendly user interface (that's functional and efficient in terms
            of code and interface design!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from UC Davis in the summer of 2021 with a B.S. in computer
            science and a B.A. in design, 5 years worth of tenor saxophone playin' 
            in the marching band--where we played loud and danced freely, and 
            lots of bike riding, picnics in the parks, and lots of happy memories. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After the disruption of Covid-19 on my life, socially, physically, 
            and mentally, I decided to pursue a childhood, lifelong dream of mine
            and became a Cast Member for the Walt Disney Company for the remainder of
            2021 and into 2022. It was just what I needed, and now I'm pursuing a full 
            time job in the UI/UX Design and Product Management realm. Please don't hesitate
            to contact me if anything you've seen or read on my site excites you!
