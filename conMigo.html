            their children will lead healthy lifestyles?
        </h3>

        <p class="item-2">
            Especially if the parents weren’t even leading these themselves? 
            When the Covid-19 pandemic shut the doors on society as we knew it, 
            parents took on new roles as a teacher, a friend, an entertainer, 
            all while continuing on with their career and, not to mention, 
            their continuous role as role-model and parent. Children were 
            looking even closer at their parents’ daily habits, and without 
            the stimulation of school and social activities, many parents 
            worried the habits their children formed during this unconventional 
            time would alter their lives forever.

            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <img id="team" src="./images/Team.png">
            <p>
                We were tasked with creating a convenience for families 
                during quarantine—whether that took shape digitally or physically.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="item-4">The Interviews.</h2>

        <p class="item-5"> We interviewed 5 parents, over Zoom, about their experience during
            quarantine. These interviews took place in Spring of 2021, when 
            some of the severity of the shelter-in-place orders were being 
            lifted, but when many still felt uncomfortable completely 
            assimilating back into society. 
        </p>

        <p class="item-6">
            <i>And the interviews were telling.</i> The parents shared their struggles 
            through body language and deep sighs, through the retelling of 
            stories, and even through where they chose to interview, with one 
            mother interviewing in her car while on a lunch break. Two of our 
            parents, a single mother and a single father, worked in healthcare 
            throughout the pandemic, adding an even deeper layer in which to 
            discover pain points and possibility.
